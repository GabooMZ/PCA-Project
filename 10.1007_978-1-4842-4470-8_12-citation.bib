abstract="It is critical to be able to plot the observations and variables of a dataset before subjecting the dataset to some machine learning algorithm or another. Data visualization is essential to understand your data and to glean insights into the underlying structure of the dataset. These insights help the scientist in deciding with statistical analysis or which learning algorithm is more appropriate for the given dataset. Also, the scientist can get ideas on suitable transformations to apply to the dataset.",
